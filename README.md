# Pico: A Micro.blog client for Android

This project is still very early! I threw it together just so I'd have a way to post to Micro.blog from my Android phone. It's evolving into a more fully fledged client, but it still has a long way to go.

The project uses the MIT license and requires Android version 7.1 or later. Built with Android Studio 3.1.3 against Android SDK 27. If you have trouble building the project, please make sure your copy of Android Studio is up-to-date.

Feel free to fork it or submit PRs, or just to try it out yourself.

## To use:

1. Create a new app token from your [Micro.blog account page](https://micro.blog/account)
2. Copy the token you just created
3. Run Pico and you should see a dialog asking for your app token (if you don't, please let me know!)
4. Paste in your app token and tap "Save"
